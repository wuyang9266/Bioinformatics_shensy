## Week 1

### Class Notes

1. the size of the genome

   - Why human so few gene

     - pervasive transcribed regions (there is a huge amount of  noncoding regions)
     - complex gene expression regulatory networks
     - various splicing

     - various RNA

2. the feature of bio-information

   - big data
   - high dimensional

3. the integration of data and biology problems

   -  information
   - model
     - decision tree 
     - neural network
   - algorithm
     - number sorting algorithm
     - dynamic programming algorithm

   *Distinction between algorithm and model:* 

   - *Models are those who base on algorithm to describe the laws of something.*

   - *Algorithms are mathematical tools to process the data.*
